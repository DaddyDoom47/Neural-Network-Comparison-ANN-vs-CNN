# Neural-Network-Comparison-ANN-vs-CNN
In this notebook, we will classify small images cifar10 dataset from tensorflow keras datasets. There are total 10 classes as shown below. We will use CNN for classification. We will also compare the erformance of ANN and CNN.

This is an ongoing project, whose final goal is to build a Deep Learning Architure with XGBoost/LGBM as the final layer.

For image, video, and audio-based Machine Learning problems, CNNs are the defacto standard because they are very good in feature engineering. However, for tabular datasets, boosting-based ML models like XGBoost, LGBM etc. are the defacto standards. The idea of this project is to get the best of both worlds for image, video, and audio problems by using boosting-based ML models in place of the fully-connected layers of a CNN model. In this project, we will explore how to train such hybrid models (Neural network plus boosting-based ML models) and if such models lead to better performance in terms of prediction accuracy and training time.
